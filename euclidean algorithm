R function to find the greatest common factor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm:

def euclidean_algorithm (a, b):
  #these two lines ensure that the larger inputted number is assigned to a and the smaller to b
  a = max(a, b)
  b = min(a, b)
  #using a while loop lets us make sure it continues all the way through
  while a % b != 0:
    r = a % b
    #our previous b becomes a (moves over a column)
    a = b
    #our previous remainder becomes b (moves over a column)
    b = r
    #this will continue until a %% b is 0, at which point we're done!
  return b
#call the function by putting in the two numbers for which you want to find the greatest common factor

R function to find the greatest common factor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm:

euclidean_algorithm <- function (a, b){
  #we set a vector with the input numbers
  gcf_of <- c(a, b)
  #these two lines ensure that the larger inputted number is assigned to a and the smaller to b
  a <- max(gcf_of)
  b <- min(gcf_of)
  #using a while loop lets us make sure it continues all the way through
  while (a %% b != 0){
    #the remainder is set to be what's left when a is divided by b
    r <- (a %% b)
    #our previous b becomes a (moves over a column)
    a <- b
    #our previous remainder becomes b (moves over a column)
    b <- r
    #this will continue until a %% b is 0, at which point we're done!

  } 
  return (b) 
}
#we call the function here by putting in the two numbers for which we want the gcf
